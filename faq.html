   <h1>FAQ - <i><font color="red">This project is archived/deprecated and should no longer be used</font></i></h1>
   <h2>1. What is &ldquo;bomutils&rdquo;?</h2>
   <p>bomutils are a set of tools to create Mac OS X installer packages on foreign OSes (windows, linux, etc.). These tools can be used as part of the cross-compilation process. In particular, &nbsp;it includes an open source version of the <span style="font-weight:bold">mkbom</span> tool which is distributed as closed-source version on Mac OS X Developer Tools. <span style="font-weight:bold">mkbom </span>is the missing component to create Mac OS X installer packages on foreign OSes. All other steps in generating Mac OS X installer packages are relatively straight forward (see the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>).</p>
   <p></p>
   <h2>2. What&#146;s the big deal?</h2>
   <p>Until now, it was not possible to build a Mac OS X installer package on linux, windows, etc. because&nbsp;an essential developer tool called &#145;<span style="font-weight:bold">mkbom</span>&#146; was only available on Mac OS X. With bomutils it is now possible to completely build Mac OS X applications including installers on foreign OSes. This enables a whole set of possibilities such as&nbsp;compiling Mac OS X applications with linux build-bots.</p>
   <p></p>
   <h2>3. What tools&nbsp;are included in bomutils?</h2>
   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">mkbom</span> - a tool to create a bill-of-materials file used in Mac OS X installers. mkbom&nbsp;can either create a bom file from a directory path or, with the &#145;-i&#146; option, create a bom file from a text file containing a list of files an folders. The text file must have the same format as the output of lsbom and ls4mkbom.</p>
   <p></p>
   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">lsbom</span> - list the contents of a bill-of-materials file.</p>
   <p></p>
   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">ls4mkbom</span> - given a folder, ls4bom creates a file list of that folder in the same format as the output of lsbom.</p>
   <p></p>
   <p><span style="font-weight:bold">dumpbom</span> - a debugging tool to view the internal structure of a bom file</p>
   <p></p>
   <h2>4. So how can I build an Installer on Linux/Windows/...?</h2>
   <p>Read the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>
   <p></p>
   <h2>5. How do I compile Mac OS X applications on Linux/Windows/...?</h2>
   <p>This beyond the scope of this project. However, <a href="http://devs.openttd.org/~truebrain/compile-farm/apple-darwin9.2008-09-17.txt">this</a> is a good starting point or use llvm.</p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"></p>
   <h2 dir="ltr">7. My installer is not working?</h2>
   <p dir="ltr">This can be due to several reasons. The most common reason is that the file permissions and uid/gid&nbsp;in the bom file and in the installer archive don&#146;t match. It is recommended that you always use the &#145;-i&#146; option of mkbom to create bom file from a text file containing a file list. This way you can edit the uid/gid and permissions with sed or similar before creating the bom. Also you probably want to map uid and gid when creating the instaler archive by using the &#145;--owner&#146; option in cpio. </p>
   <p dir="ltr">Also, although it is important that you compress the Payload file, the flat package installer file itself should be compressed with the xar option &#145;--compression none&#146; otherwise your package will be corrupted.</p>
   <p dir="ltr">Please see the tutorial for more help.</p>
   <h2 dir="ltr">8. Who are the authors of bomutils?</h2>
   <p dir="ltr">Principle development work was done by Fabian Renn with contributions from Joseph Coffland and Julian Devlin.</p>
